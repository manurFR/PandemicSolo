1.Introduction    
*******************
  Hello ! You are about to start a Java-application called Pandemic Solitaire. With this little program,
 you can play Matt Leacock's brilliant co-operative boardgame "Pandemic" on your own, just like a solitaire game.
 A selection of optional elements and variants from the 3 expansions are also provided.

 The application assumes that you are already familiar with the rules of the boardgame. 

 Principles:
 - The game will randomly draw a starting situation for you, placing tokens and cards on the board as appropriate.
 - After that, you will have to do all the changes, dragging elements around the board as you see fit. The game will
   only manage the Player deck and the Infection deck for you.
 - No rules of play are enforced beyond the dispatch of game elements at the start of a play, similarly to other tools
   like VASSAL.
 - The application allows you to save a current game, and to load it in a future session where you'll find your tokens
   and cards at the exact same place, and the decks (including the Infection discard pile) in the same state.

2. Requirements
********************
 This application can run on most systems that support Java. That includes all forms of Windows, Mac OS X,
 all forms of Linuxes and Unixes, and many more.

 All you need is the Java Runtime Environment 6 (or higher) installed on your computer. 
 
 If you don't already have Java, you can get it here : <http://www.java.com/download/>.
 Alternatively, make a search for "Java Runtime Environment".
  
3. Starting the application
******************************** 
 1. To start the game, simply double-click the file PandemicSolo.jar !
 
 2. If it doesn't work, please check that the "java" executable is in your PATH environment variable.
    This page may help : <http://www.java.com/en/download/help/path.xml>.
    The string you want to find or to add to the PATH is the absolute path of the "java" or "java.exe"
    executable on your hard drive. Do a search for that name if you don't know where it is installed. 
    When the PATH is updated, try again step 1.
    
 3. If it doesn't work, I have included scripts that may help. Please try to launch the script relevant
    to your operating system : "PandemicSolo.bat" on Windows, "PandemicSolo.sh" on Mac, Linux and Unix.
    
 4. If that doesn't work either, please try to open a command line window ("cmd" on Windows, "Terminal" 
    on Mac, "bash" on Linux, etc.).
    Then set the current directory where you have unzipped the downloaded archive, including the file 
    PandemicSolo.jar. 
    Finally, on Windows type : "java.exe -jar PandemicSolo.jar", or on Mac or Linux type : 
    "java -jar PandemicSolo.jar &" (without the quotes).
    Please note that the case is important !
 
 For further instructions on the gaming interface itself, you can find a "Read Instructions!" button
 once you have started the program.

 Good Luck!
 
4. Troubleshooting
********************

If one or more of the following behaviors are reported :
 - No image showing in the software
 - Error message notifying the jar file "can't be launched" or something similar
 - Error message "java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: org/slf4j/LoggerFactory" or 
    "java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: org.slf4j.LoggerFactory"
 THEN : please check that the PandemicSolo.jar is accompanied by a "lib" directory,
   at the same place, containing at least the following files : slf4j-api-1.6.1.jar, 
   AppleJavaExtensions.jar, logback-core-0.9.28.jar, logback-classic-0.9.28.jar.
 If not, please download again the zip file (which contains this directory).
